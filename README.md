# Expense Tracker

## Overview
[TODO: Write 2-3 sentences describing what your app does and why it's useful]
My app will track expenses, users will be able to see what they have spent during a specific duration, 1 week, 2 week, 3 weeks,
and ect. This is useful as users, mainly college students will be able to log their budgeting habits and see what healthy or unhealthy patterns they have. 

## Problem Statement

- What frustrates people about tracking expenses?
- Why do existing solutions fall short?

income, so they aren't liviing pay check to pay check.
